# Free code script

This is a free creation script,assigned in the subject of informatic systems,aimed to implement basic bash script knowledge in pairs :dizzy:

## Introduction

this is a task assigned in the subject of  informatic systems,aimed to implement basic bash script knowledge in pairs.This group is formed by [Sebasti√°n Estacio](https://github.com/z0s3r77) & [Samuel Piedra](https://github.com/SPiedra955) :raising_hand:

## Docker description

Docker is an open source software used to deploy applications inside virtual containers. Containerisation allows multiple applications to run in different complex environments. For example, Docker allows the WordPress content management system to run on Windows, Linux and macOS systems without any problems.

## Implementing bash with docker

For this script we have combined a bash script with a Dockerfile:

* The bash script executes a series of commands to act as a CLI and at the same time execute a series of processes such as installing, updating programs in a docker       container and creating a test user but before that we must have a container created with the port 22.

* Dockerfile this file is the second part of the script,were we are in the case that we don't have a container created with a port 22 yet,then this file is creaates a container.
